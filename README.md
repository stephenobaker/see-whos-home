# **See Who's Home** &nbsp; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stephenobaker/see-whos-home.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/stephenobaker/see-whos-home)

A simple web-based React app built with Firebase on the backend to let individuals/vendors display their presence or absence at various markets or public spaces. Users can sign in to create new market or vendor listings, open or close their vendors, and all changes update publicly for all users without requiring a reload thanks to Firebase's Realtime Database.
